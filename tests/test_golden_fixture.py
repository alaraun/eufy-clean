"""Python half of the golden grid-raster contract.

The JS half (``tests/frontend/golden.test.mjs``) decodes
``tests/frontend/fixtures/golden_render.json`` with the shipped client renderer and
asserts every cell agrees with the server. That check is only ever as good as the
fixture, so this module does the two things the JS side cannot:

1. **Staleness** — regenerate the fixture and fail if it drifted. Without this a
   change to ``build_map_geometry`` or to ``render_map_png``'s colour rule would
   leave the JS suite passing against an outdated contract, which is precisely the
   failure the cross-language check exists to prevent.
2. **Provenance** — assert the fixture's "expected" colours are the ones a *real*
   ``render_map_png`` call produces. ``generate_golden_fixture.server_cell_colors``
   restates the renderer's step-1 loop (it has to: the renderer returns a PNG with
   the overlays already burned in and the frame already flipped), so on its own it
   is a second implementation that could drift from the first. Comparing it to an
   actual render at scale 1, with every overlay stripped, closes that loop.

Regenerate with: ``PYTHONPATH=. python3 tests/generate_golden_fixture.py``
