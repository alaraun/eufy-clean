"""Generate the golden per-cell raster fixture shared by the Python and JS suites.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
--------------------------------------
``render_map_png`` (Pillow, server) and ``buildGridImageData`` (browser) rasterise
the *same* grid. Neither test suite can run the other's language, so a divergence
between them passes both suites green while the map visibly differs in a browser.
``tests/generate_classification_fixture.py`` already covers 256 random cells with a
*label* per cell; this extends that to **RGB per cell over several realistic maps**,
including the two registration details a label check cannot reach (the room mask's
``_ro_dx``/``_ro_dy`` offset, and ``room_id_offset``).

**The comparison is at SOURCE-GRID RESOLUTION — one texel per grid cell.** That is
the whole of what is comparable without a canvas:

* ``render_map_png`` builds its colour list at cell resolution (``map_stream.py``
  step 1), and only then applies ``FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM`` and a NEAREST resize to
  ``max_px``. The client does the same two operations as a single
  ``ctx.setTransform`` with a negative vertical scale plus
  ``imageSmoothingEnabled=false``. Both post-processing steps are exact and
  parameter-free given the pre-flip raster, so proving the raster equal proves the
  grid layer equal.
* Everything drawn *on top* of the grid — dock, trail, robot, zones, room labels —
  is drawn at output resolution by both ends and is **not** covered here. jsdom
  ships no 2d context, so nothing in the JS suite can render those at all.

So: this is a golden-image check of the **grid layer**, pre-flip and pre-resize.
It is not a full-frame image diff and must not be described as one.

WHERE THE TWO PALETTES DELIBERATELY DIFFER
------------------------------------------
They are not the same palette and are not meant to be:

* ``_ROOM_PALETTE`` (server) is 9 entries with index 0 reserved, so rooms cycle
  through **8** hues. ``ROOM_PALETTE`` (client) is Paul Tol's colour-blind-safe
  "muted" scheme, **10** hues, none reserved. Room fills therefore never match by
  RGB, and this fixture does not ask them to — the JS side asserts the *structure*
  (identical set of room-filled cells, one client colour per room id).
* The unknown/void cell is ``(30, 30, 30)`` opaque on the server and fully
  transparent on the client, on purpose: the card's own background shows through
  the void, which a flat PNG could not do.
* Wall, free floor and cleaned floor **do** match exactly in the light theme, and
  the JS side asserts that as a hard RGB equality.

Fixture written to ``tests/frontend/fixtures/golden_render.json``;
``tests/test_golden_fixture.py`` regenerates it and fails if it is stale, and also
checks the expected colours below against a real ``render_map_png`` call — so the
derivation here can never quietly drift from the renderer it is speaking for.
